yaf_file_mediator reads YAF IPFIX files using libfixbuf and writes flow data in 
ASCII text to stdout or to the given file.  This program is intended to read
IPFIX files generated from YAF version 2.  However it will read IPFIX
files from earlier versions of YAF, but will not decode any data that is now
contained in the subTemplateMultiList (payload, entropy, p0f, mac addresses, 
etc.)  This program is able to read all DPI elements exported from YAF's DPI
plugin and DHCP fingerprinting plugin, as well as flow statistics (YAF 2.3 
--flow-stats).
