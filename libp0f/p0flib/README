Short Story:  

Install libp0f, not p0f-2.0.8.tgz


Long Story:

p0f-2.0.8.tgz is the baseline p0f source code.  
Retrieved from:  http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f.shtml

libp0f is the autotools version of p0f with support for 3rd-party linkage. 
libp0f splits the core p0f functionality from the p0f application.  The p0f
library is installed as libp0f.so into /usr/local/lib (or wherever libp0f is
configured to place it) and the p0f application is installed into 
/usr/local/bin (configure blah blah).  

Note that libp0f does not change any of the fingerprinting algorithms in p0f.
For better or worse, libp0f uses the core p0f 2.0.8 functionality and 
fingerprints circa 2006.  Upgrading the p0f algorithms/fingerprints is the
task of another research project.

Either p0f baseline or libp0f should be installed, NOT both.  libp0f is 
recommeded as it uses the standard autotools configuration interface and allows
for 3rd-party integration.
