libp0f is the autotools version of p0f-2.x with support for 3rd-party linkage. 
libp0f splits the core p0f functionality from the p0f-2.x application.  The p0f
library is installed as libp0f.so into /usr/local/lib (or wherever libp0f is
configured to place it) and the p0f application is installed into 
/usr/local/bin (configure blah blah).
