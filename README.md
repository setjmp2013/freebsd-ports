# README

This a subdir I have going in my local /usr/ports on FreeBSD 10. My
overall goal is having these fully functional with all the option
choices I need included. When more stable, and by the full standards
of the FreeBSD ports collection, I'll submit the packages that are
not already there, and pass the ones that are in this form onto their
usual maintainers. 

This is very much still a work in progress, and what's to come include:

- yaf
- silk
- logstash
- kibana4
- more to be added
