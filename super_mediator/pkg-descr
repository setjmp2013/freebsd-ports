super_mediator is an IPFIX mediator for use with the yaf and SiLK tools. What is
an IPFIX mediator? An IPFIX mediator is an intermediate entity between IPFIX
Exporters and Collectors that can potentially provide aggregation, filtering,
and modification of IPFIX records. It may provide conversion to or from IPFIX or
a conversion of IPFIX transport protocols. super_mediator collects and processes
yaf output (IPFIX files or via TCP, UDP, or Spread) and exports that data in
IPFIX, JSON, or CSV text format to one or more IPFIX collectors such as
rwflowpack, flowcap, or to text files that may be bulk uploaded to a database.
MySQL support is provided for automatic import.
